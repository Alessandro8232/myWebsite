  Middle Ages, the period in European history from the collapse of Roman civilization in the 5th century CE to the period of the Renaissance (variously interpreted as beginning in the 13th, 14th, or 15th century, depending on the region of Europe and other factors).
  </p>
  <p>In addition to grand cathedrals, the medieval period also saw the construction of many grand castles. These grand homes grew up out of the feudal system that existed in rural Europe during the medieval period. Kings granted pieces of land to noblemen and bishops, who in turn granted the right to work the land to peasants.
